    SLI Theme Manager v1.0 README

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 If you start the SLI-ThemeManager.exe you can "manage" your themes!
 
 - You MUST copy SLI-ThemeManager.exe into "$litestepdir$utilities\" otherwise the PopupMenu actions WON'T WORK!
 - You SHOULD have installed/extracted all your themes in the Litestep $ThemesDir$
 - You CAN move all your Theme-Archives (*.zip and *.lsz) in the Litestep $ThemesDir$
 
 The List shows the recognized Themes and you can apply various tasks on them.
 Simple perform a RightClick on an entry and choose the desired action.
 
 A Left DoubleClick performs a quick ThemeSwitch.
 
 While you hover over an entry a small ThemeInfo is displayed.
 It shows (if available in ThemeFolder/theme.rc):
 ThemeName
 ThemeAuthor
 OTSVersion
 preview.bmp, preview.png, preview.jpg, or preview.gif
