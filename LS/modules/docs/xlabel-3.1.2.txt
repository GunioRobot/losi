Hi to all,
If someone is searching for the Help File.

It's still in the Zip-Archive you (or NetLoadModule) have downloaded!
Since it's a chm-File NetloadModule doesn't recognize it and therefore
don't installs it in here.

So simply go to your "Archive-Folder" mostly (if not changed)
$LitestepDir$Modules/Archive/ 
open the xLabel Zip-File and extract the CHM-File 
"xLabel_ReadMe.chm"
manually to a folder of your choice.

Done!
