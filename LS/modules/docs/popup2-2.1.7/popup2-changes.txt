2.1.7 2004-3-19 (Nathan E. Moore)
- Added support for dropshadows (windows XP only)(PopupMenu.h, PopupMenu.cpp,
  	PopupMaker.cpp)
- Changed _DllMainCRTStartup to DllMain to fix a warning (Popup.h, Popup.cpp)
- Change a integer to a unsigned integer to fix a warning (Popup.cpp)
- (2004-03-26 rabidcow) popups taller than the screen will again make sure the
  top is onscreen rather than the bottom, as in 2.1.5 and before
2.1.6 2003-12-06 (RabidCow)
- !popup now accepts "pin" and "close", can use % and center-based coords,
  and order no longer matters
  (!popup 100 200 right center = !popup center y=200 right 100)
- default alignment for popping up under the mouse cursor works better
  it will no longer get the alignment wrong for specified coords, and 
  it will flip exactly when the popup would start to go offscreen rather
  than 100 pixels away from the top left corner.
- added build type: bPopup
- changed PinnedPopupNotOnTop to PopupPinnedNotOnTop and bPopupPinnedNotOnTop

2.1.5 2003-11-29 (ilmcuts)
- Added new setting "PopupFocusFix" which defaults to "true".
  Use "PopupFocusFix FALSE" to disable Brian Todoroff's focus fix (it conflicts
  with xmouse for example)

2.1.4 2003-11-11 (RabidCow)
- the default position is now one pixel off instead of directly under
  the mouse, and it tries to flip to the other side when you're near
  the bottom-right corner instead of just pushing over.
- submenus will try to stay on the same monitor as their parent

2.1.3 2003-11-11 (RabidCow)
- updated version number
- using LSGetMonitorInfo and LSMonitorFromWindow instead of user32
  equivalents that are apparently not available on NT4

2.1.2, 2003-11-02 (Erik Christiansson, aka Sci)
- Added support for cascaded context menus

2.1.1, 2003-10-29 (mugendai, Seg@)
- Fixed missing icons in menus(bug in 2.1).
- You can now ctrl-click popup folder entries with more than one folder in them,
  and get the second folders menu. I.E. All Users and Current User on programs.
- Filtering a folder popup menu(like with Quick Launch) no longer breaks the context menu.
- Certain popup folders(I.E. ControlPanel) wouldn't display the entries properly on some
  Unicode languages(I.E. Russian), now fixed thanx to Seg@

2.1, 2003-10-18 (verbalshadow, ilmcuts)
- New RC commands below, PopupNewAmpRemote must be in RC to use the other Commands.
