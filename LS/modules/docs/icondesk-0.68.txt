General
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IconDesk is a Litestep module that displays icons on the
desktop, much like in Explorer.


Bangs
¯¯¯¯¯
!IconDeskShow <group>
Shows the specified icon group.

!IconDeskHide <group>
Hides the specified icon group.

!IconDeskToggle <group>
Toggles the visibility of the specified icon group.

!IconDeskUpdate <group>
Updates the specified group. If the group is omitted all groups
are updated.


RC-commands
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IconDesk is configured much in the same way as Maduin's Label.
Begin with specifying a list of groups to add (a group [of
icons] is basicly a folder to display). You can have as many of
these lines as you like.

IconDeskGroups name1[,name2[,name3]]

You can then specify individual settings for each group. If you
want to set the icon size for a group you add a line like this.

IconDesk<name>Size 32

Where <name> is the name of the group. The following settings
are available:

Visible <bool>
Determines whether or not the group is visible. Defaults to
true.

X <int>
Y <int>
Position on the desktop to start drawing the icons. Negative
coordinates are supported. Both defaults to 0.

Size <int>
Size of the icons, in pixels. Defaults to 32.

SpacingX <int>
SpacingY <int>
Distance between the icons. Not that the distance is calculated
between the rectangles formed by both the icons and the text.
Defaults to 0, both ways.

Direction [right|left|down|up]
The direction to draw the icons in. Defaults to right.

WrapDirection [right|left|down|up]
Direction to wrap the icons in. Defaults to down. Note: If
Direction is set to right or left, WrapDirection must be up or
down and vice versa.

WrapCount <int>
Number of icons to display before wrapping to the next line
or column. Defaults to 10.

Font <string>
FontSize <int>
FontItalic <bool>
FontBold <bool>
FontColor <colour>
Font used to display the filenames. Defaults to Arial, size 14,
white, neither bold nor italic.

TextAlign [right|left|center]
Text alignment. Defaults to center.

TextPosition [right|left|top|bottom]
The text position relative to the icon. Defaults to bottom.

TextSpacing <int>
Distance between the icon and the text. Defaults to 5.

TextWidth <int>
TextHeight <int>
Size of the box where the text is drawn. Defaults to 64x28.

TextBackground <color>
If set, this color will be used to paint a box behind the text.
Default: blank (no box is painted).

TextShadowDepth <int>
If set, a text shadow will be drawn the specified number of
pixels below and to the right of the normal text. Negative
numbers will place the shadow above and to the left of the
normal text. Defaults to 0.

TextShadowColor <color>
The color of the text shadow. Defaults to 80 80 80.

TextOutline <bool>
If set to true an outline will be drawn around the text.
Defaults to false.

TextOutlineColor <color>
Specifies the color of the text outline. Defaults to 40 40 40.

HideExtension <bool>
If set to true the extensions of the files will not be
displayed. Defaults to true.

ShowHidden <bool>
If true, files with the hidden and system attributes will
displayed. Defaults to false.

FoldersFirst <bool>
If true, all folders will be placed before all files. Defaults
to true.

NonFilesystemFirst <bool>
If true, all nonfilesystem folders (My Computer, Recycle Bin,
etc.) will be placed before everything else. Defaults to true.

HideText <bool>
If true, no text labels will be drawn. Note that this affects
the spacing of the icons. Defaults to false.

Tooltips <bool>
If true, tooltips with the title of the icon will be displayed.
Defaults to true.

Saturation <int>
Icon saturation. 255 will result in the normal icon and 0 in a
monochrome image. Defaults to 255 (= effect deactivated).

HueColor <color>
HueIntensity <int>
Color and intensity of the hue effect. The intensity should be
a number between 0 and 255. 0 will give no effect and 255 will
result in the icon being completely covered in the specified
color. Defaults to 128 128 128 (medium gray) and 0 (= effect
deactivated).

LinkOverlay <bool>
ShareOverlay <bool>
If set link and share overlays will be displayed respectively.
Both defaults to true.

LinkOverlayIcon <file>[,<index>]
ShareOverlayIcon <file>[,<index>]
Specifies an icon to use as link and share overlay
respectively. If left out the system default icon will be used.

*IconDesk<group>Folder <string>
Specifies a folder to display. You can have as many of these
lines as you want. If no lines are present .desktop will be
displayed. This can be either a normal directory, a CLSID
($drives$, $controlpanel$, etc) or ".desktop" (sans quotes).

*IconDesk<group>Mouse <event> <modifiers> <command>
Specifies a command to execute upon a certain mouse event. You
can have as many of these lines as you want. The event
parameter defines what mouse event the command should be
executed at, possible values are Left, Middle or Right directly
followed by Up, Down or Dbl. The modifiers parameter is a
combination of Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Win, Apps and .none separated
by a +. The command is either a bang command, a file or an
internal command. Internal commands are .context to open the
context menu, .properties to show the file properties and .open
to execute the file.
LeftDbl .none defaults to .open, LeftDbl Alt defaults to
.properties and RightUp .none defaults to .context.

*IconDesk<group>Hide <pattern>
Any icon that matches the pattern by either its title or its
filename will be hidden. You can have as many of these lines
as you want. For pattern syntax, see the section 'Pattern
matching'.

*IconDesk<group>First <pattern>
*IconDesk<group>Last <pattern>
Any icon matching these patterns by either its title or its
filename will be placed first/last in the icon list. You can
have as many of these lines as you want. For pattern syntax,
see the section 'Pattern matching'.


Pattern matching
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IconDesk is using the built in pattern matching functions of
Litestep. This provides a limited regular expression support.
Supported matching methods are:
 * Matching any number of characters
 ? Matching one character
 [SET] Matching any character in the set
 [!SET] or [^SET] Matching any characters not in the set
A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like
character hyphen character (as in 0-9 or A-Z). The set
[A-Za-z123] will match any character in the alphabet as well
as a 1, 2 or 3.
To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of
[]*?!^-\, and match the character exactly, precede it with a \.


Changes
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Date         Ver    Changes
14 dec 2003  0.68   Fixed drive icons.
                    Sorting is now done on filenames instead of
                    titles for filesystem objects (fixes drive
                    sorting).
                    Added support for link and share overlays,
                    use LinkOverlay and ShareOverlay settings
                    to disable them and LinkOverlayIcon and
                    ShareOverlayIcon to specify another icon
                    then the default.
                    Fixed a few problems with user defined
                    mouse actions.

23 nov 2003  0.67   Fixed folders with dots in their names not
                    being treated properly.
                    Fixed problem with folders and executables
                    with the same name.
                    Fixed problem with folders not opening on
                    some systems.
                    Fixed default group appearing with some
                    configurations.
                    Added setting NonFilesystemFirst to display
                    special folders first.
                    Implemented custom settings interface,
                    separated most of the module core from the
                    Litestep API.
                    Creating a HICON for tinted icons for
                    cleaner code.
                    Based more of the code on STL, did some
                    more cleaning and restructuring.
                    Disabled selection rects since I couldn't
                    get them to work properly.

02 nov 2003  0.66   Cascaded context menues are working again,
                    better then ever. The menu doesn't need to
                    be clicked to expand.
                    Added text outlines.
                    Added icon hiding by pattern.
                    Added basic sorting customisation by
                    pattern.
                    Fixed the redraw/flicker problem to some
                    extent.
                    Added new internal command .properties to
                    display the file properties window. Double
                    clicking with ALT pressed defaults to
                    display the properties window.
                    Using the Litestep logging functions with
                    dynamic binding to support PureLS.
                    The default folder was changed from C:\ to
                    the desktop (.desktop).
                    Fine tuned the icon extraction routine.
                    A few minor bugfixes and cleanups.
                    Fixed a typo in the readme.

26 oct 2003  0.65   New way to config mouse events, support for
                    keyboard modifiers.
                    Reverted to old context menu code, the new
                    code had large problems with stability.

26 oct 2003  0.64   Loading icons for file types that doesn't
                    specify an icon index does not crash LS.

25 oct 2003  0.63   The icon text can now be placed on any side
                    of the icon.
                    Added support for text alignment.
                    Fixed a problem with icon extraction from
                    .lnk files pointing to files other then
                    .exe/.ico/.cur/.ani-files.
                    Improved the ugly hack used to fix the My
                    Documents icons.
                    Importing the shell notification functions
                    by function ordinals to support non-XP
                    systems.
                    Reverted to a custom implementation of
                    StrRetToBuf to support non-XP systems.

19 oct 2003  0.62   Cascaded context menues (such as the Send
                    To menu) are now working.
                    Improved the update notification code.
                    Solved problem with icon duplication.
                    More code cleaning.

19 oct 2003  0.61   Hopefully fixed the white trails drawing
                    problem.
                    My Documents is now displayed with the
                    correct icon.
                    If !IconDeskUpdate is called without any
                    arguments all groups are updated.
                    Cleaned the code some more.
                    A sample configuration file is included.

18 oct 2003  0.6    New icon extraction procedure, icon sizes
                    above 32 by 32 pixels are new supported.
                    The title of My Documents is now displayed
                    corectly.
                    New update method, catches notifications
                    from the OS when a folder is updated. This
                    method also supports special folders such
                    as the desktop and My Documents. No timer
                    is used anymore and IconDeskUpdateInterval
                    is thus removed.
                    Support for multiple IconDeskGroups lines.
                    Source code cleaned up a bit.
                    Compiled with VC7 against a newer build of
                    STLport.

13 jul 2003  0.55   !IconDeskUpdate didn't cause redrawing.
                    Fixed a GDI leak (thanks to jesus_mjjg for
                    pointing it out).
                    Quoted paths are now working.
                    Added support for negative coordinates.
                    Added tooltips (disable w/ Tooltips false).
                    If the desktop window isn't found, the
                    module waits for 500 ms and then looks
                    again.

22 jun 2003  0.52   Reverted to old icon extraction mechanism.
                    Now using IShellFolder to enum the files,
                    in other words special folders such as My
                    Computer and the desktop are now supported.
                    Fixed the bug where you could still click
                    the areas where the icons where when they
                    were hidden.

11 may 2003  0.5    Add ability to hide icon texts.
                    Added customisation of mouse events.
                    Improved icon extraction a bit, still not
                    working very well with icon sizes above 32.
                    Converted to STL lists and implemented
                    sorting, still no customisation.
                    Added ability to merge folders.
                    Attribute changes in monitored folders are
                    now detected.
                    Added icon effects (hue & saturation) from
                    systray2.
                    Changed default text color to white.
                    Changed default shadow color to a darker
                    gray (80 80 80).

26 apr 2003  0.41   If no groups are specified, a group called
                    "Default" will be created.
                    All positions and distances are now
                    calculated on the rectangles formed by both
                    the icon and the text.
                    Added support for text shadows.

25 apr 2003  0.4    IconDesk is no longer a part of desktop2,
                    it's a regular module. It now works with
                    jDesk as well.
                    I decided that IconDesktop was too long,
                    the module is now called IconDesk.
                    Added support for multiple folders.
                    Readded IconDeskUpdateInterval.
                    Added !IconDeskUpdate.
                    Reworked the settings system, all settings
                    have new names.
                    Increased the default of UpdateInterval to
                    1000 milliseconds.

24 apr 2003  0.35   Code cleanup
                    Added DesktopIconVisible
                    Added !DesktopIconShow
                    Added !DesktopIconHide
                    Added !DesktopIconToggle
                    Added DesktopIconFoldersFirst
                    Added DesktopIconShowHidden
                    Removed DesktopIconUpdateInterval

24 apr 2003  0.3    First public release


To-do-list
