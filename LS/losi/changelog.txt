Originaly I used the commit log at dev.litestep.com as my changelog, but since
ls.com is down for an unknown period of time I started this changelog instead

2007-01-05: Fixed a misspelling in LanguageStrings.nsh
            Added the-golem's new icons

2007-01-15: Added the-golem's EvarConfig
            Added this file to the installation (in SecCore.nsh)

2007-01-16: Added code to refresh the icon cache so the new icons for the
            different filetypes show up without having to reboot
            Added German language strings. Thanks Sk33p.

2007-01-17: Added a whole bunch of !ifdef statements to make it easier to
            choose what pages to include in the installer. This makes testing
            of a specific page much easier. I also added a new file for the
            same reason, Pages.nsh
            Added a descriptive text to the finnishpage telling the user why
            he/she needs to reboot/logoff.

2007-01-20: Added a check to stop litestep.exe from starting if the user didn't
            want to set LS as the shell.
            Moved this changelog to the losi directory.
            Fixed the internet adress to LOSI in the .url file.
            The ioHowLS page now displays the username the user would be
            installing to if (s)he choose to install LS for the current user
            only.
            The default IM evar is hardcoded to MSN/Live Messenger. I think
            that is better than blank as it used to be.
            Got rid of the two compiler warnings about unused functions by
            adding !if 1 = 2 !endif around them. This causes them to be
            removed from the file when compiling.
            Made SetShell add the regkey "BrowseNewProcess" when setting LS as
            the shell. I also made it change "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\
            CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot". This stops
            explorer from taking over. So now you can use SetShell.exe to set
            LS as the shell even if it has never been the shell before.
            Added some nice headers/comments to evars.rc

2007-01-24: Added pfx's icons.
            Added the new ThemeSwitcher. pfx noticed a while ago that the
            version of ThemeSwitcher that was included with the installer
            would crash if any of the theme.rc files in the ls theme dir
            had "" as ThemeAuthor, ThemeVersion or ThemeName. I fixed
            when he noticed it, but forgot to add the fixed version to LOSI.
            I've also updated the default themeslist.rc to use
            ThemeSwitcher.exe instead of LSThemeInstaller.exe

2007-01-27: LS wouldn't find the theme when installing to AppData. This is
            now fixed.

2007-02-25: Changed the license text (but not the actual license)

2007-03-03: Began work on a page where you can choose between a "Normal
			Install" and an "Advanced Install"

2007-07-14: Made the evar configuration during install remeber your
			choices when going back and forth between the two evar
			configuration pages. Thanks to jc for finding and fixing
			this bug.
			Updated/Added some language strings to LanguageStrings.nsh.
			Thanks to jc for those too.
			Made LOSI print the full/long installation path instead of
			the short, 8.3 version of it. Thanks to jc for telling me
			to do it :)
