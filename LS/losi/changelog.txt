Originaly I used the commit log at dev.litestep.com as my changelog, but since
ls.com is down for an unknown period of time I started this changelog instead

2007-01-05: Fixed a misspelling in LanguageStrings.nsh
            Added the-golem's new icons

2007-01-15: Added the-golem's EvarConfig
            Added this file to the installation (in SecCore.nsh)

2007-01-16: Added code to refresh the icon cache so the new icons for the
            different filetypes show up without having to reboot
            Added German language strings. Thanks Sk33p.

2007-01-17: Added a whole bunch of !ifdef statements to make it easier to
            choose what pages to include in the installer. This makes testing
            of a specific page much easier. I also added a new file for the
            same reason, Pages.nsh
            Added a descriptive text to the finnishpage telling the user why
            he/she needs to reboot/logoff.

2007-01-20: Added a check to stop litestep.exe from starting if the user didn't
            want to set LS as the shell.
            Moved this changelog to the losi directory.
            Fixed the internet adress to LOSI in the .url file.
            The ioHowLS page now displays the username the user would be
            installing to if (s)he choose to install LS for the current user
            only.
            The default IM evar is hardcoded to MSN/Live Messenger. I think
            that is better than blank as it used to be.
            Got rid of the two compiler warnings about unused functions by
            adding !if 1 = 2 !endif around them. This causes them to be
            removed from the file when compiling.
            Made SetShell add the regkey "BrowseNewProcess" when setting LS as
            the shell. I also made it change "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\
            CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot". This stops
            explorer from taking over. So now you can use SetShell.exe to set
            LS as the shell even if it has never been the shell before.
            Added some nice headers/comments to evars.rc

2007-01-24: Added pfx's icons.
            Added the new ThemeSwitcher. pfx noticed a while ago that the
            version of ThemeSwitcher that was included with the installer
            would crash if any of the theme.rc files in the ls theme dir
            had "" as ThemeAuthor, ThemeVersion or ThemeName. I fixed
            when he noticed it, but forgot to add the fixed version to LOSI.
            I've also updated the default themeslist.rc to use
            ThemeSwitcher.exe instead of LSThemeInstaller.exe

2007-01-27: LS wouldn't find the theme when installing to AppData. This is
            now fixed.

2007-02-25: Changed the license text (but not the actual license)

2007-03-03: Began work on a page where you can choose between a "Normal
            Install" and an "Advanced Install"

2007-07-14: Made the evar configuration during install remeber your
            choices when going back and forth between the two evar
            configuration pages. Thanks to jc for finding and fixing
            this bug.
            Updated/Added some language strings to LanguageStrings.nsh.
            Thanks to jc for those too.
            Made LOSI print the full/long installation path instead of
            the short, 8.3 version of it. Thanks to jc for telling me
            to do it :)

2007-08-06: Changed LSDir to LitestepDir in the registry (HKLM\Software\
            LOSI\Installer\)

2007-10-08: Finished a new version of the SetShell util. This time it's written
            in LUA.

2007-10-09: Added SLI-ThemeManager to the installer and updated a couple of .rc
            files to support it.
            Updated formating and a few entries in popup.rc
            Changed the shortcuts to change the shell to use the new LOSS
            written in lua

2007-10-10: Added a new option for installing LOSI stuff (for example icons and
            utils). This used to be done when installing the core, but is now
            it's own option. In the process I also made the file association
            a little smarter so it doesn't try to set an icon that doesn't
            exist.

2007-10-14: I fixed some little things today that I noticed when I tried to do
            a full install with losi. I associated .lsz files with
            SLI-ThemeManager.exe. The shortcuts to LOSS on the desktop and in
            the startmenu are now working. I had to supply the full path to the
            *.lua files. Added a messagebox when you switch shells using
            command line parameters (i.e. by using shortcuts). It'll ask you if
            you want to reboot/logoff (Yes or No) or if you want to Undo the
            shell switching. I fixed the code that's supposed to launch explorer
            after uninstalling LS.

2007-10-15: The LOSS shortcuts still didn't work. Now they do. It was a PITA to
            get all the ' and " right :p

2007-10-19: The "Add/Remove Programs" dialog from the control panel froze when
            uninstalling LS. I finally managed to fix this today. The trick was
            to make windows start explorer on its own when I shut down Litestep.

2007-10-27: Cleaned up Evars.nsh and added some more comments to LOSI.nsi just
            just to tidy it up a bit before commiting everything to the
            repository.
            Made KillLS as nice as un.KillLS already was (using ls.exe !quit).
            Fixed the lsz file association, it wasn't working. Did a small
            adjustment in popup.rc to make the links to LOEC and LOSS work.
