First I would like to thank all who have helped develop LS and all its modules.

Then I think Syl deserves a big "Thank You" as he was the one who got me in to
writing a LiteStep installer.

fractal.design also deserves a big Thank You. He corrected my English in many
places, fixed the sweet graphics used in the installer, and generaly made me
keep working on this installer

pfx also deserves to be mentioned as he made one of the icon sets included with
the installer

One of the biggest motivators has been the-golem. His continous interest
in the installer has really kept me going. He has also made all the default
icons in the installer. He has also written the EvarConfig util. So all in
all it's safe to say that this installer would not be here if it wasn't
for him. Thank you the-golem!

I'd like to thank Andymon for writing the xModules and by doing that keeping
the LS community active and interested. I'd also like to thank him for writing
SLI-ThemeManager used in LOSI.

And last but not least I would like to thank all my alpha and beta testers:
wols
Syl
TucknDar
the-golem
fractal.design
and many more, you know who you are!
